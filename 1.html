  <p>hello web
  Hello <strong>my name is <u>Peter</u>, from south Korea</strong>
  </p>


  <p>Capitalism is an economic system based upon private
  ownership of the means of production and their operation
  for profit.</p><p style="margin-top:45px;">Characteristics central to capitalism
  include private property, capital accumulation, wage labor,
  voluntary exchange, a price system and competitive markets.
  In a capitalist market economy, decision-making and investment
  are determined by every owner of wealth, property or production
  ability in financial and capital markets, whereas prices and the
  distribution of goods and services are mainly determined by
  competition in goods and services markets.</p>
